    <h2 style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting; color: lightcoral; font-size: 26px; background-color:white" >&#127926; Introduction &#127926;</h2>
<p style="background-color:white"> One of my favourite hobby is to play the <b> guitar. </b> <br> This is because playing the guitar helps me to relax and wind down from the stresses of life. 
<br> On top of that, playing the guitar helps me to truly immerse myself in a musical world. </p> <br>

<h3 style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting; color: lightcoral;font-size: 26px; background-color:white"> &#127932;How did I learn the guitar?&#127932; </h3>
<p style="background-color:white"> I was very blessed with the opportunity to learn guitar when I was in secondary 2 under my school's music curriculum.
<br> The teacher who taught me was really passionate with teaching us and this actually started my interest in guitar. <br>
For someone with no prior musical knowledge, he was able to scaffold the learning to one where it was really easy to follow. 
<br>He also taught us various ways and methods to learn chords. <br>
He started with teaching us the more <b> common chords </b> first such as the <i> Em, Dm, G and C </i> chords as they were easier to master, before we proceeded to learn more difficult chords such as the <i> F and D7 </i> chords. </p>
 
<h4 style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting; color: lightcoral;font-size: 26px; background-color:white">&#128522; My Guitar journey &#128522; </h3>       
<p style="background-color:white"> After learning it in Secondary 2, I was truly amazed and in love with this musical instrument and really wanted to learn more about it. 
<br> As a result, I decided to take it up as my Co-Curriculum Activity in Junior College. 
<br> Being a part of the <b> Guitar Ensemble team </b> really further enhanced my love and understanding for this instrument. 
<br> I was able to have the opportunity to learn a <i> different </i> way of playing the instrument, by learning how to play <b> tabs. </b>
<br> I also learned how to play together as an ensemble and this was really an enriching and meaningful experience as it taught me that <b> team work truly makes the dream works! </b> </p>

<p style="background-color:white"> These guitars hold a special meaning in my heart.&#129505; <br> The purple one (guitar on the right) is an acoustic guitar which my Father bought for me when I was 14 years old as I was starting out on guitar journey.
<br> The brown one (guitar on the left) is a classical guitar which I have saved up by working part-time jobs to buy it when I was in my junior college days! <br>
