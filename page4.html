<h2> <li id style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; background-color: powderblue">A website that allows you to be exposed to numerous songs and their chords </h2>
<p> This website is great as it allows you to search from a large data base of songs to find their chords so you can strum and sing along to it or if you prefer to play the melody, it also has tabs of many songs. 
<br> The website also features the top songs of either <i> Today </i> or <i> All-time. </i>
<br> If none of the top songs are what you feel like playing to, you can even <i> search for your own desired songs! </i> 
<br> Also, you are able to zoom over each chord if you are unsure of how to play it and an image would show up immediately guiding you on how to play it. 
<br> Still unsure? They even have a video on the bottom right corner of the screen to guide you too! </p>
